Symbols for swiss cantons based on their coat of arms. Initially they were thought to be displayed next to the name of a corresponding canton to improve the readability of lists. Optimized to be displayed at 13px width/height. Symbols representing cantons named using [ISO 3166-2:CH](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:CH) (without CH-). City symbols named using [UN/LOCODE](http://www.unece.org/cefact/codesfortrade/codes_index.html)  (without CH ).
